# MedFlow AI — Deep Dive Implementation Guide

This guide breaks down each day of the 5-day MVP build, explaining the **logic**, **data flow**, and **AI integration** behind every feature.

---

## ✅ DAY 1: The Core Foundation
*This phase established the "brain" and the "skeleton" of the application.*

1.  **Supabase Schema**: We deployed 12 interconnected tables (patients, doctors, appointments, medications, beds, etc.). This isn't just a list; it's a relational database that ensures, for example, a medication is always linked to a specific patient and prescribed by a specific doctor.
2.  **Role-Based Auth**: Using Supabase Auth, we created a gateway. When a user logs in, the app checks their `role` in the `profiles` table and routes them to the correct experience.
3.  **The AI "Mothership" (Edge Function)**: We built a single, powerful API endpoint (`ai-agent`). Instead of separate functions for every agent, we pass an `agent_type`. This function pulls the correct **System Prompt** (e.g., "Act as a Cardiologist") and sends it to Claude with the user's data.

## ⏳ DAY 2: The Patient Agent
*Objective: Build an interface that makes patients feel cared for and informed.*

1.  **Patient Dashboard**: A personalized home screen. It queries the `medications` and `appointments` tables specifically for the logged-in `user_id`.
2.  **The Patient Assistant**: This isn't just a chatbot; it's a **Context-Aware Agent**. When a patient asks "When should I take my meds?", the Edge Function sends their medication list along with the question, so the AI knows exactly what to say.
3.  **Booking Engine**: A 3-step wizard. It reads the `doctors` table to show available specialties and writes a new row to the `appointments` table upon confirmation.
4.  **AI Triage**: A safety feature. The AI analyzes symptoms (e.g., "I have chest pain") and looks for red flags. It doesn't just give advice; it assigns a `priority_level` (1 for Emergency, 4 for Routine) to help the hospital prioritize care.

## 📅 DAY 3: The Doctor Agent
*Objective: Automate clinical documentation so doctors can focus on patients.*

1.  **Doctor Queue**: A live view of the `appointments` table filtered by `doctor_id` and `current_date`.
2.  **AI Briefing**: Before a doctor enters a room, the AI reads the patient's entire history (labs, last visit, allergies) and summarizes it into 3 sentences: *"Patient is here for follow-up. Last BP was high. Allergic to Penicillin."* This saves minutes of scrolling.
3.  **SOAP Note Generator**: Doctors hate typing. They can dictate "Patient has cough, clear lungs, start Amoxicillin" and the AI formats it into a professional **S**ubjective, **O**bjective, **A**ssessment, **P**lan structure.
4.  **Order Management**: A UI that adds rows to `medical_records` or `lab_results`. It's the digital version of a prescription pad.

## 🏥 DAY 4: Operations & Family Support
*Objective: Manage hospital resources and keep loved ones informed.*

1.  **Admin Dashboard**: Aggregates data from the `beds` table. It shows occupancy rates (e.g., "ER is at 90% capacity") to help admins make staffing decisions.
2.  **Visual Bed Board**: A grid layout where each square represents a physical bed. Clicking a "Red" (Occupied) bed shows who is in it and when they might leave.
3.  **The Family Translator**: Medical jargon is scary for families. The `family_agent` takes a complex doctor's note and "translates" it: *"Your mother's heart rate is stable, and she is responding well to the new medicine."*
4.  **Visit Scheduler**: Manages visitors to prevent overcrowding, writing to a dedicated `visits` table.

## 🚀 DAY 5: The "Glue" & Polishing
*Objective: Make the app feel like a premium, finished product.*

1.  **Automated Notifications**: Using Supabase triggers, when a doctor saves a note (Day 3), a notification is automatically created in the `notifications` table for the patient (Day 2) and family (Day 4).
2.  **Navigation Logic**: A dynamic sidebar that hides clinical tools from patients and billing tools from doctors.
3.  **Demo Scenarios**: We pre-configure 3 buttons that "reset" the data to show a perfect walkthrough. For example, "Start ER Scenario" will populate a specific patient profile and bed assignment so you can show the flow live.
4.  **UI/UX Polish**: Adding "Loading Skeletons" (grey pulses while data loads) and a dark-mode teal theme to give it that high-tech "MedFlow" aesthetic.
